## If...else statements

`If...else` statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition, or set of conditions, being met.

{% highlight js %}
  if (// this expression is true //) {
    // run this code
  } else {
    //run this code
  }
{% endhighlight %}

This is extremely helpful because it allows you to choose which piece of code you want to run based on the result of an expression. For example,

{% highlight js %}
  var a = 1;
  var b = 2;

  if (a > b) {
    console.log("a is greater than b");
  } else {
    console.log("a is less than or equal to b");
  }
{% endhighlight %}


Console will print: "a is less than or equal to b"

A couple of important things to notice about `if...else statements`.

The value inside the `if` statement is always converted to true or false. Depending on the value, the code inside the `if` statement is run or the code inside the `else` statement is run, but not both. The code inside the `if` and `else` statements are surrounded by curly braces `{...}` to separate the conditions and indicate which code should be run.

ðŸ’¥ When coding, sometimes you may only want to use an `if` statement. However, if you try to use only an `else` statement, then you will receive the error `SyntaxError: Unexpected token else`. Youâ€™ll see this error because `else` statements need an `if` statement in order to work. You canâ€™t have an `else` statement without first having an `if` statement.

## Else If Statements

In some situations, two conditionals arenâ€™t enough. Consider the following situation.

You're trying to decide what to wear tomorrow. If it is going to snow, then youâ€™ll want to wear a coat. If it's not going to snow and it's going to rain, then youâ€™ll want to wear a jacket. And if it's not going to snow or rain, then youâ€™ll just wear what you have on.

In JavaScript, you can represent this secondary check by using an extra if statement called an `else if` statement.

{% highlight js %}

  var weather = "sunny";

  if (weather === "snow") {
    console.log("Bring a coat.");
  } else if (weather === "rain") {
    console.log("Bring a rain jacket.");
  } else {
    console.log("Wear what you have on.");
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Console will prints: Wear what you have on.

By adding the extra `else if` statement, you're adding an extra conditional statement.

If itâ€™s not going to snow, then the code will jump to the `else if` statement to see if itâ€™s going to rain. If itâ€™s not going to rain, then the code will jump to the `else` statement.

The `else` statement essentially acts as the "default" condition in case all the other if statements are false.

## Logical Operators

Let's say Julia is planning to meet with Colt over the weekend to do something... Hereâ€™s the logical expression used to represent Juliaâ€™s weekend plans:

{% highlight js %}

  var colt = "not busy";
  var weather = "nice";

  if (colt === "not busy" && weather === "nice") {
    console.log("go to the park");
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: "go to the park"

Notice the && in the code above.

The `&&` symbol is the logical `AND` operator, and it is used to combine two logical expressions into one larger logical expression. If `both` smaller expressions are true, then the entire expression evaluates to true. If `either one` of the smaller expressions is false, then the whole logical expression is false.

Another way to think about it is when the `&&` operator is placed between the two statements, the code literally reads, "if Colt is not busy AND the weather is nice, then go to the park".

#### Logical expressions

Logical expressions are similar to mathematical expressions, except logical expressions evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

Entering `11 != 12`

Console will print: true

Youâ€™ve already seen logical expressions when you write comparisons. A comparison is just a simple logical expression.

Similar to mathematical expressions that use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`, there are logical operators `&&`, `||` and `!` that you can use to create more complex logical expressions.

#### Logical operators

Logical operators can be used in conjunction with boolean values (`true` and `false`) to create complex logical expressions.

By combining two boolean values together with a logical operator, you create a logical expression that returns another boolean value. Hereâ€™s a table describing the different logical operators:

By using logical operators, you can create more complex conditionals like Juliaâ€™s weekend example.

ðŸ’¥ Logical expressions are evaluated from left to right. Similar to mathematical expressions, logical expressions can also use parentheses to signify parts of the expression that should be evaluated first.
