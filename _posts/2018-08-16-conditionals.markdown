## If...else statements

`If...else` statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition, or set of conditions, being met.

{% highlight js %}
  if (// this expression is true //) {
    // run this code
  } else {
    //run this code
  }
{% endhighlight %}

This is extremely helpful because it allows you to choose which piece of code you want to run based on the result of an expression. For example,

{% highlight js %}
  var a = 1;
  var b = 2;

  if (a > b) {
    console.log("a is greater than b");
  } else {
    console.log("a is less than or equal to b");
  }
{% endhighlight %}


Console will print: "a is less than or equal to b"

A couple of important things to notice about `if...else statements`.

The value inside the `if` statement is always converted to true or false. Depending on the value, the code inside the `if` statement is run or the code inside the `else` statement is run, but not both. The code inside the `if` and `else` statements are surrounded by curly braces `{...}` to separate the conditions and indicate which code should be run.

ðŸ’¥ When coding, sometimes you may only want to use an `if` statement. However, if you try to use only an `else` statement, then you will receive the error `SyntaxError: Unexpected token else`. Youâ€™ll see this error because `else` statements need an `if` statement in order to work. You canâ€™t have an `else` statement without first having an `if` statement.

## Else If Statements

In some situations, two conditionals arenâ€™t enough. Consider the following situation.

You're trying to decide what to wear tomorrow. If it is going to snow, then youâ€™ll want to wear a coat. If it's not going to snow and it's going to rain, then youâ€™ll want to wear a jacket. And if it's not going to snow or rain, then youâ€™ll just wear what you have on.

In JavaScript, you can represent this secondary check by using an extra if statement called an `else if` statement.

{% highlight js %}

  var weather = "sunny";

  if (weather === "snow") {
    console.log("Bring a coat.");
  } else if (weather === "rain") {
    console.log("Bring a rain jacket.");
  } else {
    console.log("Wear what you have on.");
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Console will prints: Wear what you have on.

By adding the extra `else if` statement, you're adding an extra conditional statement.

If itâ€™s not going to snow, then the code will jump to the `else if` statement to see if itâ€™s going to rain. If itâ€™s not going to rain, then the code will jump to the `else` statement.

The `else` statement essentially acts as the "default" condition in case all the other if statements are false.

## Logical Operators

Let's say Julia is planning to meet with Colt over the weekend to do something... Hereâ€™s the logical expression used to represent Juliaâ€™s weekend plans:

{% highlight js %}

  var colt = "not busy";
  var weather = "nice";

  if (colt === "not busy" && weather === "nice") {
    console.log("go to the park");
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: "go to the park"

Notice the && in the code above.

The `&&` symbol is the logical `AND` operator, and it is used to combine two logical expressions into one larger logical expression. If `both` smaller expressions are true, then the entire expression evaluates to true. If `either one` of the smaller expressions is false, then the whole logical expression is false.

Another way to think about it is when the `&&` operator is placed between the two statements, the code literally reads, "if Colt is not busy AND the weather is nice, then go to the park".

#### Logical expressions

Logical expressions are similar to mathematical expressions, except logical expressions evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

Entering `11 != 12`

Console will print: true

Youâ€™ve already seen logical expressions when you write comparisons. A comparison is just a simple logical expression.

Similar to mathematical expressions that use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`, there are logical operators `&&`, `||` and `!` that you can use to create more complex logical expressions.

#### Logical operators

Logical operators can be used in conjunction with boolean values (`true` and `false`) to create complex logical expressions.

By combining two boolean values together with a logical operator, you create a logical expression that returns another boolean value. Hereâ€™s a table describing the different logical operators:

![Operators](/pic/operators.PNG)

By using logical operators, you can create more complex conditionals like Juliaâ€™s weekend example.

ðŸ’¥ Logical expressions are evaluated from left to right. Similar to mathematical expressions, logical expressions can also use parentheses to signify parts of the expression that should be evaluated first.

## Logical AND and OR

Before you advance any further in the lesson, hereâ€™s the truth tables for logical `AND` (` && `) and logical `OR` (` || `).

![Truth Table](/pic/andor.PNG)

Truth tables are used to represent the result of all the possible combinations of inputs in a logical expression. `A` represents the boolean value on the left-side of the expression and `B` represents the boolean value on the right-side of the expression.

Truth tables can be helpful for visualizing the different outcomes from a logical expression. However, do you notice anything peculiar about the truth tables for logical AND and OR?

#### Short-circuiting

![Short Circuiting](/pic/shortcircuiting.PNG)

In both tables, there are specific scenarios where regardless of the value of `B`, the value of `A` is enough to satisfy the condition.

For example, if you look at `A AND B`, if `A` is false, then regardless of the value `B`, the total expression will always evaluate to `false` because both `A` and `B` must be `true` in order for the entire expression to be `true`.

This behavior is called `short-circuiting` because it describes the event when later arguments in a logical expression are not considered because the first argument already satisfies the condition.

## Truthy and Falsy

Every value in JavaScript has an inherent boolean value. When that value is evaluated in the context of a boolean expression, the value will be transformed into that inherent boolean value.

#### Falsy values

A value is `falsy `if it converts to `false` when evaluated in a boolean context. For example, an empty String `""` is falsy because, `""` evaluates to `false`. You already know if...else statements, so let's use them to test the truthy-ness of `""`.

{% highlight js %}
if ("") {
    console.log("the value is truthy");
} else {
    console.log("the value is falsy");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: "the value is falsy"

Hereâ€™s the list of all of the falsy values:

  - the Boolean value false

  - the null type

  - the undefined type

  - the number 0

  - the empty string ""

  - the odd value NaN (stands for "not a number", check out the NaN MDN article)

That's right, there are only six falsy values in all of JavaScript!

#### Truthy values

A value is `truthy` if it converts to `true` when evaluated in a boolean context. For example, the number `1` is truthy because, `1` evaluates to `true`. Let's use an if...else statement again to test this out:

{% highlight js %}

if (1) {
    console.log("the value is truthy");
} else {
    console.log("the value is falsy");
}

{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: "the value is truthy"

Here are some other examples of truthy values:

{% highlight js %}
true
42
"pizza"
"0"
"null"
"undefined"
{}
[]
{% endhighlight %}

## Ternary Operator

Sometimes, you might find yourself with the following type of conditional.

{% highlight js %}

var isGoing = true;
var color;

if (isGoing) {
  color = "green";
} else {
  color = "red";
}

console.log(color);

{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: "green"

In this example, the variable `color` is being assigned to either `"green"` or `"red"` based on the value of `isGoing`. This code works, but itâ€™s a rather lengthy way for assigning a value to a variable. Thankfully, in JavaScript thereâ€™s another way.

ðŸ’¥ Using `if(isGoing)` is the same as using `if(isGoing === true)`. Alternatively, using `if(!isGoing)` is the same as using `if(isGoing === false)`.

The ternary operator provides you with a shortcut alternative for writing lengthy if...else statements.

`conditional ? (if condition is true) : (if condition is false)`

To use the ternary operator, first provide a conditional statement on the left-side of the `?`. Then, between the `?` and `:` write the code that would run if the condition is `true` and on the right-hand side of the `:` write the code that would run if the condition is `false`.

For example, you can rewrite the example code above as:

{% highlight js %}
var isGoing = true;
var color = isGoing ? "green" : "red";
console.log(color);
{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: "green"

This code not only replaces the conditional, but it also handles the variable assignment for `color`.

If you breakdown the code, the condition `isGoing` is placed on the left side of the `?`. Then, the first expression, after the `?`, is what will be run if the condition is true and the second expression after the, `:`, is what will be run if the condition is false.

## Switch Statement

If you find yourself repeating `else if` statements in your code, where each condition is based on the same value, then it might be time to use a `switch statement`.

{% highlight js %}
if (option === 1) {
  console.log("You selected option 1.");
} else if (option === 2) {
  console.log("You selected option 2.");
} else if (option === 3) {
  console.log("You selected option 3.");
} else if (option === 4) {
  console.log("You selected option 4.");
} else if (option === 5) {
  console.log("You selected option 5.");
} else if (option === 6) {
  console.log("You selected option 6.");
}
{% endhighlight %}


A `switch statement` is an another way to chain multiple `else if` statements that are based on the same value `without using conditional statements`. Instead, you just switch which piece of code is executed based on a value.

{% highlight js %}
switch (option) {
  case 1:
    console.log("You selected option 1.");
  case 2:
    console.log("You selected option 2.");
  case 3:
    console.log("You selected option 3.");
  case 4:
    console.log("You selected option 4.");
  case 5:
    console.log("You selected option 5.");
  case 6:
    console.log("You selected option 6.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, each `else if` statement `(option === [value])` has been replaced with a `case` clause (`case: [value]`) and those clauses have been wrapped inside the switch statement.

When the switch statement first evaluates, it looks for the first `case` clause whose expression evaluates to the same value as the result of the expression passed to the switch statement. Then, it transfers control to that `case` clause, executing the associated statements.

So, if you set `option` equal to `3`...

{% highlight js %}
var option = 3;

switch (option) {
  case 1:
    console.log("You selected option 1.");
  case 2:
    console.log("You selected option 2.");
  case 3:
    console.log("You selected option 3.");
  case 4:
    console.log("You selected option 4.");
  case 5:
    console.log("You selected option 5.");
  case 6:
    console.log("You selected option 6.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Console will print:

{% highlight js %}
You selected option 3.
You selected option 4.
You selected option 5.
You selected option 6.
{% endhighlight %}

...then the switch statement prints out options 3, 4, 5, and 6.

But thatâ€™s not exactly like the original `if...else` code at the top? So whatâ€™s missing?

#### Break statement

The break statement can be used to terminate a switch statement and transfer control to the code following the terminated statement. By adding a `break` to each `case` clause, you fix the issue of the switch statement falling-through to other case clauses.

{% highlight js %}

var option = 3;

switch (option) {
  case 1:
    console.log("You selected option 1.");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("You selected option 2.");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("You selected option 3.");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("You selected option 4.");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("You selected option 5.");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("You selected option 6.");
    break; // technically, not needed
}
{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: You selected option 3.

## Falling-through

In some situations, you might want to leverage the "falling-through" behavior of switch statements to your advantage.

For example, when your code follows a hierarchical-type structure.

{% highlight js %}

var tier = "nsfw deck";
var output = "Youâ€™ll receive "

switch (tier) {
  case "deck of legends":
    output += "a custom card, ";
  case "collector's deck":
    output += "a signed version of the Exploding Kittens deck, ";
  case "nsfw deck":
    output += "one copy of the NSFW (Not Safe for Work) Exploding Kittens card game and ";
  default:
    output += "one copy of the Exploding Kittens card game.";
}

console.log(output);

{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: Youâ€™ll receive one copy of the NSFW (Not Safe for Work) Exploding Kittens card game and one copy of the Exploding Kittens card game.

In this example, based on the successful Exploding Kittens Kickstarter campaign (a hilarious card game created by Elan Lee), each successive tier builds on the next by adding more to the output. Without any break statements in the code, after the switch statement jumps to the `"nsfw deck"`, it continues to fall-through until reaching the end of the switch statement.

Also, notice the `default` case.

{% highlight js %}

var tier = "none";
var output = "Youâ€™ll receive ";

switch (tier) {
  ...
  default:
    output += "one copy of the Exploding Kittens card game.";
}

console.log(output);

{% endhighlight %}

Console will print: Youâ€™ll receive one copy of the Exploding Kittens card game.

You can add a `default` case to a switch statement and it will be executed when none of the values match the value of the switch expression.
