Strings are a collection of characters enclosed inside double or single quotes. You can use strings to represent data like sentences, names, addresses, and more.

It is correct to either use double `"` or single `'` quotes with strings, as long as you're consistent.

#### String Concatenation

Did you know you can even add strings together? In JavaScript, this is called concatenating. Concatenating two strings together is actually pretty simple!

Entering `"Hello," + " New York City"`

Console will print: "Hello, New York City"

ðŸ’¥ For consistency single-quotes `(')` are preferred over double-quotes `(")`. This is helpful when creating strings that include HTML: `const element = '<button class="btn">Click Me</button>';`
