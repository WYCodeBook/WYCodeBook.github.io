### Document Object Model - otherwise known as the DOM

When you request a website, no matter what backend language is powering that website, it will respond with HTML. The browser receives a stream of HTML. The bytes are run through a complicated (but fully documented) parsing process that determines the different characters (e.g. the start tag character `<`, an attribute like `href`, a closing angle bracket like `>`). After parsing has occurred, a process called tokenization. Tokenization takes one character at a time and builds up tokens. The tokens are:

  - DOCTYPE
  - start tag
  - end tag
  - comment
  - character
  - end-of-file

Let's take a break for a second. At this state, the browser has received the bytes that've been sent by a server. The browser has converted the bytes to tags and has read through the tags to create a list of tokens.

This list of tokens then goes through the tree construction stage. The output of this stage is a tree-like structure - this is the DOM!

So the DOM is a model (representation) of the relationships and attributes of the HTML document that was received. Remember that DOM stands for "Document Object Model".

### The DOM is standardized by the W3C. There are a number of specifications that make up the DOM, here are few:

  - Core Specification
  - Events Specification
  - Style Specification
  - Validation Specification
  - Load and Save Specification

To see the full list of DOM specs, check out the standard at: https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/dom#w3c_all

### .getElementById()

This is used to gain access to specific elements using their ID attribute.

`document.getElementById('content');`

Running this code cause the document object to search through its entire tree-like structure for the element that has an ID of "content"

### .getElementsByClassName()

Similarly to `.getElementById()`, if we ran the code above in the console, we wouldn't get anything, because we did not tell it the class to search for! Also just like `.getElementById()`, `.getElementsByClassName()` is expecting that we call it with a string of the class we want it to search for/return:

`document.getElementsByClassName('brand-color');`

Running this code cause the document object to search through its entire tree-like structure for the element that has a class name of "brand-color"

### .getElementsByTagName()

Similar to the `.getElementById()` and `.getElementsByClassName()`... `.getElementsByTagName()` is expecting that we call it with a string of the tag name we want to search for/return:

`document.getElementsByTagName('p');`

Running this code cause the document object to search through its entire tree-like structure for the element that has a tag name of "p"
