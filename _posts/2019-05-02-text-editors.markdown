A text editor lets you open a file as a text document, something that can be useful for a number of reasons:

- Create a file from scratch using a specific programming language, like an HTML or CSS file for use on a website

- Edit or build files that end with the TXT, REG, XML, CSV, ASP, BAT, AU3, PHP, AHK, SVG, or JS file extension, among many others

- View the text version of a file that you don't know the format for

- Quickly remove formatting like bold, custom font types, URL hyperlinks, etc.
