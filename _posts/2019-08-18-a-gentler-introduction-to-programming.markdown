This [write-up](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-gentler-introduction-to-programming-1f57383a1b2c/) is divided into 4 parts. After reading through each part, you will find a quiz section to help you better recall what you’ve read. Then you’ll find a “going forward” section and answers to the quiz.
