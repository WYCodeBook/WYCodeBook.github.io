## A basic HTML structure to build the first web page.

## <!DOCTYPE>

The `<!DOCTYPE>` is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag. The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is NOT case sensitive.

## <html>...</html>

The `<html>` tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document. The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document. All other tags must fall between the `<html>` tags.

## <head>...</head>





{% highlight html %}

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>First Web Page</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans+Condensed:300|Sonsie+One" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
      </head>
      <body>
        Basic content for the first web page.
      </body>
    </html>

{% endhighlight %}
