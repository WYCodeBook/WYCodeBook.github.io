## Document Type <!DOCTYPE>

The `<!DOCTYPE>` is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is used to declear HTML 5. The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag. The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is NOT case sensitive.

## The HTML <html>...</html>

The `<html>` tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document. The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document. All other tags must fall between the `<html>` tags.

## Header <head>...</head>

The `<head>` contains information about the document that will not appear on the actual page. The `<head>` element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.


## Title <title>...</title>

The `<title>` tag is required in all HTML documents and it defines the title of the document in the title bar of your web browser.

## Metadata <meta ...>

Metadata is data (information) about data. `<Meta>` tags contain information about the page that does not need to be displayed, but it still used by search engines and other web crawlers. `<meta>` can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.

ðŸ’¡ HTML5 has a new attribute, charset, which makes it easier to define charset: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

## <link ...>

The `<link>` tag defines a link between a document and an external resource. The `<link>` tag is used to link to stylesheet(s). The `<link>` element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.

ðŸ’¡ Since there are many version if Internet Explorer, remember to link older versions of IE to ensure codes are working properly: `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans+Condensed:300|Sonsie+One" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`

## The Body <body>...</body>

The `<body>` tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page. The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.

## Example: Basic HTML structure

{% highlight html %}

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>First Web Page</title>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans+Condensed:300|Sonsie+One" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
      </head>
      <body>
        Basic content for the first web page.
      </body>
    </html>

{% endhighlight %}
