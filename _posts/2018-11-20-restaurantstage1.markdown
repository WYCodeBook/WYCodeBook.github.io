## Project Overview: Stage 1

This is the stage 1 for the restaurant review app project for FEND. Will need to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Will need to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Get the Starter Code

### Starter Code is created by Udacity:

To begin, go ahead and clone the starter code from [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). The code provided will serve as your baseline to begin development.

### Project is completed by Wen Yu:

The completed project is available [here](https://curious-yu.github.io/restaurant-stage-1/).

## How to clone the game

  1. On GitHub, navigate to [the main page of this repository](https://github.com/Curious-Yu/restaurant-stage-1).
  2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
  3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.
  4. Open Git Bash.
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
  7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## What do I do from here?

1. You will need to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

## Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
