Markup Language:

A series of commands used to format, organize and describe information on a Webpage.

Responsive Design:

- An approach to Web development that uses a series of techniques to make Webpages dynamic and accessible on all device screen sizes.
- Responsive design includes practices like defining sizes in percentages rather than absolute pixels, and checking device specifications to deliver one of multiple style sheets that best fit the user's needs.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):

- The traditional authoring language used to develop Webpages for many applications.
- HTML is standardized by an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
- HTML is the markup language that defines page structure, hyperlinks, graphics and more to enable pages to render in Web browsers and other devices.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):

- A technology that allows greater style definition and formatting control of HTML elements. Formatting can be placed within the HTML or called remotely from an external style sheet.
- Cascading style sheets is currently in its third version (CSS3)

Cloud Computing:

- Software, infrastructure and platform services that are hosted by a remote data center and provided to organizations or individuals over the Internet.
- These servers can now be located in the "cloud" (i.e., a remote data center that is accessed over the Internet).

Text Editor and Markup Language:

- You do not need to use a special editor application to create HTML. You can use a simple text editor.
- You should save it with the .htm or .html file name extension. Many operating systems and Web browsers are configured with Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to automatically process files with these extensions.
- Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME): A protocol that enables operating systems to map file name extensions to corresponding applications. Also used by applications to automatically process files downloaded from the Internet.
