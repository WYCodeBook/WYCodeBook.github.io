## What's HTML?

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML describes the structure of web pages using markup. HTML elements are represented by tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.

## Web Browsers

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

## HTML Tags

HTML tags normally come in pairs. `<tagname> content goes here... </tagname>`

- The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag. The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.

- The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.
