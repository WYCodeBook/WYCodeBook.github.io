Markup Language:

A series of commands used to format, organize and describe information on a Webpage.

Responsive Design:

- An approach to Web development that uses a series of techniques to make Webpages dynamic and accessible on all device screen sizes.
- Responsive design includes practices like defining sizes in percentages rather than absolute pixels, and checking device specifications to deliver one of multiple style sheets that best fit the user's needs.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):

- The traditional authoring language used to develop Webpages for many applications.
- HTML is standardized by an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
- HTML is the markup language that defines page structure, hyperlinks, graphics and more to enable pages to render in Web browsers and other devices.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):

- A technology that allows greater style definition and formatting control of HTML elements. Formatting can be placed within the HTML or called remotely from an external style sheet.
- Cascading style sheets is currently in its third version (CSS3)

Cloud Computing:

- Software, infrastructure and platform services that are hosted by a remote data center and provided to organizations or individuals over the Internet.
- These servers can now be located in the "cloud" (i.e., a remote data center that is accessed over the Internet).

Text Editor and Markup Language:

- You do not need to use a special editor application to create HTML. You can use a simple text editor.
- You should save it with the .htm or .html file name extension. Many operating systems and Web browsers are configured with Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) to automatically process files with these extensions.
- Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME): A protocol that enables operating systems to map file name extensions to corresponding applications. Also used by applications to automatically process files downloaded from the Internet.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):

- A program that provides visual navigation with menus and screen icons, and performs automated functions when users click command buttons.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) markup editor applications place markup instructions into files for you; you do not need to know HTML to use GUI editors.
- Many GUI HTML editors still do not produce valid HTML.
- Commands are displayed on the graphical user interface as they will appear in a browser, thus the programs are often called WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors.
- Some developers feel that using a GUI editor application saves time. Others feel that GUI editors create confused HTML code and do not provide true flexibility.
- Popular GUI HTML editors include Adobe Dreamweaver, Microsoft Expression Web, Mozilla SeaMonkey and Google Web Designer.

History of Markup Languages:

Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML): A metalanguage used to create other languages, including HTML and XHTML.

- originally created by IBM and was standardized in 1986 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
- a powerful markup language that describes documents by organizing concepts separately from their visual presentation.
- purpose was to describe only the information within a document, not the formatting of it.
- SGML essentially requires that you create, or define, your own document language rules. This set of language rules is called the Document Type Definition (DTD).
- Document Type Definition (DTD): A set of rules contained in a simple text file that defines the structure, syntax and vocabulary as it relates to tags and attributes for a corresponding document.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):

- Tim Berners-Lee of MIT invented Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) with colleagues from CERN (the European Particle Physics Laboratory) as a means of distributing non-linear text, called hypertext, to multiple points across the Internet.
- In HTML, one document links to another via pointers called hyperlinks.
- Hyperlinks are embedded instructions within a text file that call another location in the file or a separate file when the link is accessed, usually by a click of a mouse.
- HTML does not allow you to define a DTD and has fewer language elements than SGML.
- The latest version of HTML, called HTML5, is not based on SGML and DTD is no longer required.
