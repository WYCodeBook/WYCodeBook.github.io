Every epic stories usually start with... long long time ago.

My journey on the Flatiron Online Software Engineering Bootcamp started a few years back. Then I took a long break to complete my BS degree in Computer Science. Now I am coming back to finish the bootcamp with only *20 days* left to complete. Everything must be completed by the end of *June 2021*!

Since every minutes in this next *20 days* are crusial, I will keep my talking short here.

### Current Status

According to my course profile:

Lessons Completed (182 / 653)
*meaning I have completed 27.8% of the lessons of 06/08/2021*

Labs Completed (87 / 340)
*meaning I have completed 25.5% of the labs as of 06/08/2021*

Plus...

I have 5 Portfolio Projects and blog posts to complete

### Few Life Obstacles

* I am working as full-time, that takes out about 8-9 hours per day.

* I need to be responsive to family members who love to chat and talk.

* I still have basic human needs to be functional, that takes out about 10 hours per day.

### Technical Obstacles

* I am no longer connected to the Flatiron Schools' Slack Group. Meaning as of this moment my only resources for help is Google and Flatiron TCs. Google is on 7/24, however, it may be hard to find the specific answer I needed from too many choices. Flatiron TCs are helpful, but they go to bed at 11pm and will not be avaliable till the next morning. (I Finally joined the slack group. But noticed not that many people are active about projects. A little disappointment here.[How to Join Slack](https://flatironschoolsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005609942-How-to-Join-Slack))

* Since I took a break from Flatiron for sometime, I no longer have an assigned lead instructor or section instructor. (Hope chatting with the Program Coach 06/09/2021 can resolve this problem)

* I am a visual person. I may need to run codes every few steps to see how things turn out before completing the lab/project.
