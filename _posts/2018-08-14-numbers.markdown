## Numbers

Defining a number in JavaScript is actually pretty simple. The Number data type includes any positive or negative integer, as well as decimals. Entering a number into the console will return it right back to you.

Entering `3`

Console will print: `3`

#### Arithmetic operations

You can also perform calculations with numbers pretty easily. Basically type out an expression the way you would type it in a calculator.

Entering `3 + 2.1`

Console will print: `5.1`

#### Comparing numbers

What about comparing numbers? Can you do that? Well of course you can!

Just like in mathematics, you can compare two numbers to see if oneâ€™s greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

Entering `5 > 10`

Console will print: `false`

Entering `5 < 10`

Console will print: `true`

Entering `5 == 10`

Console will print: `false`

Comparisons between numbers will either evaluate to true or false. Here are some more examples, so you can try it out!

ðŸ’¥ The values true and false have significant importance in JavaScript. These values are called Booleans and are another data type in JavaScript. Later in this lesson, youâ€™ll learn more about why Booleans are so important in programming.
