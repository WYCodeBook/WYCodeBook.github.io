## What is Version Control?

Version Control System is just software that helps you control (or manage) the different versions...of something (typically source code).

Version Control is to create control version points to recover back/forth.

## Version Control System Info

There are [a number of Version Control Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software) out there. This alone should prove that version control is incredibly important. Three of the most popular version control systems are:

  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

  - [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/)

  - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

ðŸ’¥ Git and GitHub is different. Git is the version control tool. GitHub is the service that hosts Git projects.

#### There are two main types of version control system models:

the centralized model - all users connect to a central, master repository

Centralized Model: there is one all powerful central computer that hosts the project. Every interaction must go through this central computer.

the distributed model - each user has the entire repository on their computer

Distributed Model: there is no central repository of information (no central computer). Each developer has a complete copy of the project on their computer (which means you can work off-line). Git is an example of distributed version control system.

ðŸ’¥ Remember that the main point of a version control system is to help you maintain a detailed history of the project as well as the ability to work on different versions of it. Having a detailed history of a project is important because it lets you see the progress of the project over time. If needed, you can also jump back to any point in the project to recover data or files.

## Version Control In Daily Use

Now you might not think that you're using version control when working with documents, and you'd be right...sort of. You're not actively maintaining different versions of a document as you write it. But that doesn't mean there aren't different versions of the document. The computer is keeping track of the different versions for you!

Don't believe me? Aside from pondering your propensity towards doubting, let's prove I'm right:

  - open up your favorite text editor/code editor
  - type some content (how about "version control is dull!")
  - change one of the words in you wrote (e.g. change "dull" to "life-changing awesome")
  - now (here it comesâ€¦!) press `cmd + z` or `ctrl + z` (undo function)

Practically every application I've ever used has an undo feature. You can think of this as a form of version control, but it's a rather limited form of version control.

#### Revision History Isn't Powerful Enough

`Google Docs' Revision` history page is incredibly powerful! I've used it on several occasions to salvage text that I'd written at one point, erased, and then realized I actually did want to keep.

But for all its ability, it's not as powerful as we'd like. What's it missing?

  - the ability to label a change

  - the ability to give a detailed explanation of why a change was made

  - the ability to move between different versions of the same document

  - the ability to undo change A, make edit B, then get back change A without affecting edit B

The version control tool, Git, can do all of those things - and more!!!

## Git and Version Control Terminology

[Git Key Terms](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/June/59399479_ud123-git-keyterms/ud123-git-keyterms.pdf)

## Terminology

#### Version Control System / Source Code Manager

A version control system (abbreviated as VCS) is a tool that manages different versions of source code. A source code manager (abbreviated as SCM) is another name for a version control system.

Git is an SCM (and therefore a VCS!). The URL for the Git website is https://git-scm.com/ (see how it has "SCM" directly in its domain!).

#### Commit

Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit (save the state of your project in Git), it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. You can think of it as a save point in a game - it saves your project's files and any information about them.

Everything you do in Git is to help you make commits, so a commit is the fundamental unit in Git.

#### Repository / repo

A repository is a directory which contains your project work, as well as a few files (hidden by default on Mac OS X) which are used to communicate with Git. Repositories can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer. A repository is made up of commits.

#### Working Directory

The Working Directory is the files that you see in your computer's file system. When you open your project files up on a code editor, you're working with files in the Working Directory.

This is in contrast to the files that have been saved (in commits!) in the repository.

When working with Git, the Working Directory is also different from the command line's concept of the current working directory which is the directory that your shell is "looking at" right now.

#### Checkout

A checkout is when content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory.

#### Staging Area / Staging Index / Index

A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit. You can think of the staging area as a prep table where Git will take the next commit. Files on the Staging Index are poised to be added to the repository.

#### SHA

A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit. Here's what a commit's SHA might look like: `e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6`.

It is a 40-character string composed of characters (0â€“9 and aâ€“f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. "SHA" is shorthand for "Secure Hash Algorithm".

#### Branch

A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main line of development. This alternative line of development can continue without altering the main line.

Going back to the example of save point in a game, you can think of a branch as where you make a save point in your game and then decide to try out a risky move in the game. If the risky move doesn't pan out, then you can just go back to the save point. The key thing that makes branches incredibly powerful is that you can make save points on one branch, and then switch to a different branch and make save points there, too.

With this terminology in mind, let's take a high-level look at how we'll be using Git by looking at the typical workflow when working with version control.
