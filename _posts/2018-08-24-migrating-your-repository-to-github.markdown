This course helps you seamlessly migrate a project using GitHub's importer tool. Along the way, we will also discuss important steps for preparing and sharing your project.

In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to:

  - Prepare your project for a successful migration
  - Handle any binary files currently stored in your project
  - Create important Git files like a `.gitignore`
  - Import your project to GitHub

## Step 1: Plan the migration

Migrating your repository to GitHub gives you the feature-rich tools and collaboration needed to elevate your project to the next level. This course will guide you through the necessary steps to migrate your repository from another version control system to GitHub.

## Important considerations for migrations

If you are moving from another version control system such as Mercurial, Subversion, or another Git platform, you will need to make a few decisions:

  1. Do you need all of the history?

  2. Is there project data that lives outside of the history you need to preserve? (ex: Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests)
