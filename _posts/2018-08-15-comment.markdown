You can use comments to help explain your code and make things clearer.

In JavaScript, comments are marked with a double forward-slash `//`. Anything written on the same line after the `//` will not be executed or displayed.

To have the comment span multiple lines, mark the start of your comment with a forward-slash and star, and then enclose your comment inside a star and forward-slash `/* â€¦ */`.

{% highlight js %}

// this is a single-line comment

/*
this is
a multi-line
comment
*/

{% endhighlight %}
