#### Hoisting

Hoisting is a result of how JavaScript is interpreted by your browser. Essentially, before any JavaScript code is executed, all variables are "hoisted", which means they're raised to the top of the function scope. So at run-time, the `getClothing()` function actually looks more like thisâ€¦

Without Hoisting...

{% highlight js %}
function getClothing(isCold) {
  if (isCold) {
    var freezing = 'Grab a jacket!';
  } else {
    var hot = 'Itâ€™s a shorts kind of day.';
    console.log(freezing);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

With Hoisting...

{% highlight js %}
function getClothing(isCold) {
  var freezing, hot;
  if (isCold) {
    freezing = 'Grab a jacket!';
  } else {
    hot = 'Itâ€™s a shorts kind of day.';
    console.log(freezing);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## let and const

Variables declared with `let` and `const` eliminate this specific issue of hoisting because theyâ€™re scoped to the block, not to the function. Previously, when you used `var`, variables were either scoped globally or locally to an entire function scope.

If a variable is declared using `let` or `const` inside a block of code (denoted by curly braces `{ }`), then the variable is stuck in what is known as the temporal dead zone until the variableâ€™s declaration is processed. This behavior prevents variables from being accessed only until after theyâ€™ve been declared.

{% highlight js %}
function getClothing(isCold) {
  if (isCold) {
    let freezing = 'Grab a jacket!';
  } else {
    let hot = 'Itâ€™s a shorts kind of day.';
    console.log(freezing);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Rules for using let and const

`let` and `const` also have some other interesting properties.

  - Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned, but canâ€™t be redeclared in the same scope.

  - Variables declared with `const` must be assigned an initial value, but canâ€™t be redeclared in the same scope, and canâ€™t be reassigned.

## Use cases

The big question is when should you use `let` and `const`? The general rule of thumb is as follows:

  - use `let` when you plan to reassign new values to a variable

  - use `const` when you donâ€™t plan on reassigning new values to a variable

Since `const` is the strictest way to declare a variable, we suggest that you always declare variables with `const` because it'll make your code easier to reason about since you know the identifiers won't change throughout the lifetime of your program. If you find that you need to update a variable or change it, then go back and switch it from `const` to `let`.

## What about var?

Is there any reason to use `var` anymore? Not really.

There are some arguments that can be made for using `var` in situations where you want to globally define variables, but this is often considered bad practice and should be avoided. From now on, we suggest ditching `var` in place of using `let` and `const`.
