Headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. `<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading.

ðŸ’¥ Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property. However, it's not recommended, because your codes will be cleaner if you systemically apply styles in the CSS stylesheet(s).

{% highlight html %}
  <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  <h2>Heading 2</h2>
  <h3>Heading 3</h3>
  <h4>Heading 4</h4>
  <h5>Heading 5</h5>
  <h6>Heading 6</h6>
{% endhighlight %}
