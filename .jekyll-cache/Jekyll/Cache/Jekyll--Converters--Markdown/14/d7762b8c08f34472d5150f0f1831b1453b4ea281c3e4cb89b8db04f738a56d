I"­<p>This is a 30 days JavaScript coding challenge from https://javascript30.com/ by Wes Bos</p>

<h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who is it for?</h2>

<p>Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM without a library.</p>

<p>Challenger should already know some JavaScript to start - This isnâ€™t a JavaScript 101 course. We learn by application - encountering many new situations while talking about the hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them.</p>

<p>The challenge steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.</p>

<p>These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page. If you are stuck in console.log() land, these videos are your next step.</p>
