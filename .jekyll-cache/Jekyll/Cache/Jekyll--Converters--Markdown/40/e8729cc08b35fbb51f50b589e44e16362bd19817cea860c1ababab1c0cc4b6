<h2 id="project-overview-stage-1">Project Overview: Stage 1</h2>

<p>This is the stage 1 for the restaurant review app project for FEND. Will need to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Will need to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-do-from-here">What do I do from here?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you donâ€™t even need to know Python. For most people, itâ€™s already installed on your computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python -V</code>. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code> (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 -m http.server 8000</code>. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, navigate to Pythonâ€™s <a href="https://www.python.org/">website</a> to download and install the software.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With your server running, visit the site: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8000</code>, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="leafletjs-and-mapbox">Leaflet.js and Mapbox:</h2>

<p>This repository uses <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leafletjs</a> with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>. You need to replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;your MAPBOX API KEY HERE&gt;</code> with a token from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>. Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.</p>

<h2 id="note-about-es6">Note about ES6</h2>

<p>Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.</p>
